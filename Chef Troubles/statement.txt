Its time to shop. You have a budget B. You need to buy N ingredients, numbered 1...N. There are M different shops numbered 1...M, which sell these ingredients.

The i-th shop sells the j-th ingredient, at a price P[i][j] and quality Q[i][j].

You are a Master Chef and you know that the quality of a dish is equal to the quality of the lowest quality ingredient.
